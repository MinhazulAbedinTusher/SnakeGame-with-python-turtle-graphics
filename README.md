# SnakeGame-with-python-turtle-graphics

In last term, i learnt python programming language. 
In the last class, our teacher Mantaka Taimullah sir showed implementing a game, called 'Pong', with turtle graphics in the class.

I am making this game to practice the language and also to have some fun.
I got the idea of making snake game from 'geeksforgeeks', but the code is totally written by me. My code and mechanism is totally different from theirs.
There are still some small bugs but if i try to fix one it creates more problems than before. Also I don't want to invest more time on it. 
So uploading it.

You can play the game by downloading the 'SnakeGame' folder and opening the 'SnakeGame.exe' file. (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cFVRSAl8FIDkwVQegQdD1is9xqbUZ0hh?usp=sharing)
